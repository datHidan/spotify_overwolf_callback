# Privacy Policy for ValoSpotify Control
**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

**ValoSpotify Control** ("we", "our", or "the App") is a desktop application developed by **Hidan** for the Overwolf platform. This policy explains how we handle your data.

### 1. Data Collection & Storage
The App functions locally on your device. **We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to any external servers.**

* **Spotify Tokens:** To control your music, the App authenticates with Spotify. The resulting Access Tokens are stored locally on your machine (in your browser's `LocalStorage`). These tokens are used strictly to communicate directly between your computer and Spotify's official API. We do not have access to your Spotify login credentials.
* **Game Data:** The App uses the Overwolf Game Event Provider (GEP) to read real-time Valorant game states (e.g., "Round Phase", "Health", "Death"). This data is processed instantly in your computer's memory to trigger music automation and is not recorded or sent anywhere.

### 2. Third-Party Services
The App interacts with the following third-party services:
* **Spotify:** We use the Spotify Web API to play/pause music. By using this App, you agree to Spotify’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/privacy-policy/).
* **Overwolf:** The App runs on the Overwolf platform. Overwolf may collect aggregate usage statistics according to their own [Privacy Policy](https://www.overwolf.com/legal/privacy).

### 3. Data Security
Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your own computer's security measures. We do not maintain a database of user information.

### 4. Contact Information
If you have questions about this policy, please contact the developer via the Overwolf App Store support page.
